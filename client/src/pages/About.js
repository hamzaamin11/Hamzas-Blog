              Many people look for ways to expand their online presence and
              while one of the most popular strategies is launching a blog, not
              everyone knows what is a blog and how to start one. When blogs
              first emerged around 1994, people used them mainly to share their
              personal lives, including their experiences and interests. Now,
              blogs have become an essential online marketing strategy for
              businesses and one of the most profitable career choices for
              individuals. The interface of blogs has changed significantly over
              time. Bloggers can now integrate various widgets and plugins into
              their platforms, such as a social media feed, a contact form, or
              an author profile. In this article, you’ll learn what makes a blog
              different from a regular website. We’ll also discuss common blog
              types and the necessary components such as a hosting plan to start
              your own blog.
